# Vercel Python SDK

## ðŸš¨ This library is currently in alpha. Not many resources are supported and the core API is subject to change.

## Install

Requires >= python 3.7

```bash
pip install vercel
```

## Quickstart

```python
import vercel

vercel.api_key = 'xxxxxx'

user = vercel.User.get()

print(user.name) # example
```

### Team Resources

To access resources owned by a team, set the `team_id`.

You can learn more about the authentication process [here](/docs/reference/authentication).

```python
import vercel

vercel.api_key = 'xxxxxx'
vercel.team_id = 'my-team

vercel.Domain.create(
    domain_name='mydomain.com'
)
```
